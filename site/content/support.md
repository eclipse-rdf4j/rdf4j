## Ask about or discuss RDF4J


**[RDF4J Github Discussions](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/discussions)** is the best place to ask questions, propose new ideas or discuss other issues related to RDF4J.

You can also find us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/eclipse/rdf4j?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge), if you prefer an instant messaging style of communication. However, we make no promises that any of the RDF4J developers will be online at any given time.

We previously used a Google group called rdf4j-users. This group has now been archived. You can still [browse the archive](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/rdf4j-users), but no new posts will be accepted.

The RDF4J development team uses the [rdf4j-dev@eclipse.org mailinglist](https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/rdf4j-dev) to discuss development progress.

## Reporting bugs and requests for improvement

If you think you’ve found a bug in RDF4J, or wish to log a request for a new feature or improvement, please use the [RDF4J issue tracker](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/issues). Before you add your new issue, though, please have a look around to see if it’s not already there.
