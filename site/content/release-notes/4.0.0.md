For a complete overview, see [all issues fixed in 4.0.0](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/milestone/30?closed=1).

## Upgrade notes 

RDF4J 4.0.0 contains several [backward incompatible
changes](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%E2%9B%94+Not+backwards+compatible%22+milestone%3A%224.0.0%22), including removal of several deprecated modules and classes.

### Java 11 required

RDF4J 4.0.0 requires Java 11 at a minimum. Any projects still running older versions of Java will need to upgrade their JVM/JDK before updating their RDF4J version ([GH-2046](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/issues/2046)).

### LuceneSpinSail removed

The LuceneSpinSail component, which was first marked deprecated in release 3.0.3, has now been removed from the RDF4J project ([GH-1706](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/issues/1706)).

### SeRQL support removed

The parser for the SeRQL query language, as well as all related code and tool options, has been removed from RDF4J. If you still have SeRQL queries in your project, you will need to rewrite them into SPARQL syntax before upgrading ([GH-2992](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/issues/2992)).
