RDF4J 5.2.0 is a minor release that fixes 9 issues.

### Highlights
*	Explain plans over HTTP. You can now request EXPLAIN via the REST API, making it easier to diagnose and tune slow SPARQL queries.
*	SPARQL queries using MINUS and OPTIONAL clauses are significantly faster.
*  Performance improvements to the LMDB Store, reducing query time by an average of 50% and reducing overhead for concurrent queries.
*	Configurable LMDB GC. A new valueEvictionInterval lets you tune (or disable) LMDB value‑cache garbage collection to balance latency vs. memory.

### Other improvements
*	Higher bulk‑ingest throughput for Sails that build on AbstractSailConnection thanks to an experimental bulk‑add hook.
*	SPARQL UPDATE operations now show up in the query/update logs.

### Bug fixes
*	Geospatial accuracy (Lucene). Filters like ehContains now correctly exclude geometries outside the requested area when a resource has multiple shapes.
*	Namespace operations on unknown repositories now return 404 instead of 500.
*	The SPARQL parser now rejects invalid CONSTRUCT templates that contain property paths, with a clear error.
