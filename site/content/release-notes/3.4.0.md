title: "3.4.0"
---
RDF4J 3.4.0 is a minor release with improvements in RDF\* and SPARQL\* support, and several bug fixes.

Some highlights:

- the SPARQL Query Results JSON parser has been extended to be able to process JSON query results with RDF\* from Jena-based or Stardog-based endpoints;
- Query results writers are now configurable to send base64-encoded RDF\* triples or using extended format;
- a bug in processing of SPARQL\* update operations has been fixed;
- `rdf4j:nil` is the new virtual graph name for the default graph (replacing `sesame:nil`).
