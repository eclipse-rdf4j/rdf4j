RDF4J 3.3.0 is a minor release that is backward compatible with previous RDF4J releases.

Highlights:

- A new mechanism for providing per-transaction configuration settings is now available in the Repository and SAIL APIs. Currently used by the [ShaclSail](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/programming/shacl/#performance).
- The ShaclSail now supports sh:inversePath (limited to single predicates) and sh:hasValue.
- [Custom SPARQL functions](https://rdf4j.org/javadoc/3.3.0/org/eclipse/rdf4j/query/algebra/evaluation/function/Function.html) now allow inspection of the triplestore state during evaluation.
- Improved query plan rendering.
- Utility functions for working with [RDF Containers](https://rdf4j.org/javadoc/3.3.0/org/eclipse/rdf4j/model/util/RDFContainers.html) (Alt, Bag, Seq) added.
- Experimental support for various new SHACL features ([DASH and RSX](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/programming/shacl/#supported-shacl-features))
- Elasticsearch, Lucene and Solr upgrades
- Support for Java 13 and 14
- Performance improvements and bug fixes

## Upgrade notes 

This release is binary compatible with previous releases. 

RDF4J 3.1.x and 3.2.x implicitly included the jackson-core, jackson-databind and jackson-annotations dependencies when using the `rdf4j-rio-api` maven artifact. In version 3.3.0, these dependencies are explicitly excluded.
Projects relying on this unintended behavior should check if they need to add these jackson dependencies to their build files.
