We are very pleased to announce the release of RDF4J 3.1.0. This is a minor release, addressing over 60 issues, including a number of major new features and improvements. Some of the highlights:

- Integrated support for sophisticated federated querying through [FedX](/documentation/programming/federation/).
- The [ElasticSearchStore](/databases/), a new experimental storage backend. 
- `QueryResult` and `RepositoryResult` objects now implement Java `Iterable`, making client code simpler and smoother.
- Helper functions for stripping away context / named graph info from `Statement` and `Model` objects.

See the [release notes](/release-notes/3.1.0) for more details.
