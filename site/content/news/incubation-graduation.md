We are pleased to announce that Eclipse RDF4J has officially graduated from the
[incubation phase](https://eclipse.org/projects/what-is-incubation.php), and is
now considered a mature Eclipse project. Graduating from Incubation is a
recognition of the fact that the RDF4J project is an open-source
project with an open and transparent process, an active and growing community,
and Eclipse-quality technology.
