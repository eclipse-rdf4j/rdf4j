The second milestone build of the upcoming 3.6.0 release of RDF4J is now available for download.

RDF4J 3.6.0 is a minor release focusing on improving our SHACL implementation. The main improvements include support for `sh:node` and nested `sh:property`.

This second milestone build is not yet feature-complete, but we are putting it out to receive early feedback on all the improvements we have put in.
