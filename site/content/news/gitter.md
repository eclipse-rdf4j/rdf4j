We are trying out a new way for you to get support, provide feedback and otherwise discuss anything related to RDF technologies in general, and RDF4J in particular: [Gitter](https://gitter.im/eclipse/rdf4j). 

Gitter is an open-source instant messaging and chat room system. We have a Gitter room dedicated to RDF4J at https://gitter.im/eclipse/rdf4j where everybody is welcome to join.
