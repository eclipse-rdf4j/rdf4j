The first milestone build of the upcoming 3.5.0 release of RDF4J is now available for download.

RDF4J 3.5.0 is a minor release with a number of new features and improvements. Some of the highlights:

- Java 15 support
- Performance improvements in remote query processing
- Improved support for custom character encodings in RDF and Query Result writers

This first milestone build is not yet feature-complete, but we are putting it out to receive early feedback on all the improvements we have put in.
