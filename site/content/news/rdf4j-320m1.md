The first milestone build of the upcoming 3.2 release of RDF4J is now available for download.

RDF4J 3.2.0 is a minor release with a number of new features and improvements. Some of the highlights:

- Experimental support for [RDF\*](/documentation/programming/rdfstar/)
- Remote SHACL Validation reports in the Workbench
- Various significant performance improvements

This first milestone build is not yet feature-complete, but we are putting it out to receive early feedback on the major new feature (RDF\* support), as well as on any of the other improvements we have put in.
