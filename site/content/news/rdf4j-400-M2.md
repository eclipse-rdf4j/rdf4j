Milestone number 2 of the upcoming 4.0.0 release of RDF4J is now available for download.

RDF4J 4.0.0 is a major release of the RDF4J framework, focusing on improved performance and improved maintainability. We've done a massive clean up of the project structure, which is intended to make it easier to deliver new features in this and future releases.

Some of the highlights covered in this second milestone:

- the LMDB Store, a new persistent embedded RDF Store based on the Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB) - see the [documentation](/documentation/programming/lmdb-store) for details
- massive improvements in (concurrent) performance of various aspects of the framework, including the memory store, the SPARQL and SHACL engine, and more
- more cleanups of deprecated code

For more details see the [release notes](/release-notes/4.0.0-m2).
