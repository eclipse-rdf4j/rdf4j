The first milestone build of the upcoming 3.1 release of RDF4J is now available for download.

RDF4J 3.1.0 is a minor release with a number of new features and improvements. Some of the highlights:

- Integrated support for sophisticated federated querying through [FedX](/documentation/programming/federation/).
- The [ElasticSearchStore](/databases/), a new experimental storage backend. 

This first milestone build is not yet feature-complete, but we are putting it out to receive early feedback on these two major new features, as well as on any of the other improvements we have put in.
