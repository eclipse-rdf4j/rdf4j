As you can see, we've given our website a fresh coat of paint. We've updated our site to use the Eclipse Solstice theme, and have unified our general website and documentation site in a single project. This makes updating, maintaining, and improving the site and the project documentation a lot easier.

We've done our best to port all existing documentation with a minimum of changes in addresses. Of course, there may be some glitches here, please bear with us, and feel free to report problems in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/issues/), or submit a pull request with a fix to the [rdf4j-doc github repository](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j-doc).
