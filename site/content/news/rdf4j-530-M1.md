Milestone number 1 of the upcoming 5.3.0 release of RDF4J is now available for download.

RDF4J 5.3.0 is a minor release focusing on stability and getting the code ready for the next major release. 

### Notable changes in 5.3.0 M1

 - The Var implementation used in the query engine now supports custom implementations through the Java Service Provider Interface (SPI). See: [Var.java](https://github.com/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/blob/1fd83f729d0c1a23d66cda2eeea5b77994d1b586/core/queryalgebra/model/src/main/java/org/eclipse/rdf4j/query/algebra/Var.java#L320)
 - The Solr Sail has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.

This milestone build is not yet feature-complete, but we are putting it out to receive early feedback on the deprecation.
