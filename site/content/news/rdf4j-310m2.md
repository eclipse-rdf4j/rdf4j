The second milestone build of the upcoming 3.1 release of RDF4J is now available for download.

RDF4J 3.1.0 is a minor release with a number of new features and improvements. Some of the highlights:

- Integrated support for sophisticated federated querying through [FedX](/documentation/programming/federation/).
- The [ElasticSearchStore](/databases/), a new experimental storage backend. 
- `QueryResult` and `RepositoryResult` objects now implement Java `Iterable`, making client code simpler and smoother.
- Helper functions for stripping away context / named graph info from `Statement` and `Model` objects.

This second milestone build is not yet feature-complete, but we are putting it out to receive early feedback on these two major new features, as well as on any of the other improvements we have put in.
