Milestone number 3 of the upcoming 3.6.0 release of RDF4J is now available for download.

RDF4J 3.6.0 is a minor release focusing on improving our SHACL implementation. This milestone build also contains a much improved Models.isomorphic(...) algorithm with vastly better performance and a lower memory footprint.

This milestone build is not yet feature-complete, but we are putting it out to receive early feedback on all the improvements we have put in.
