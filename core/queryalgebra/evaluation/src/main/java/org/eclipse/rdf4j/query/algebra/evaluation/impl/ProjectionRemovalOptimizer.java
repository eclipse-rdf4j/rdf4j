/**
 * If a projection node in the algebra does not contribute or change the results it can be removed from the tree.
 *
 * For example <code>
 * SELECT ?s ?p ?o
 * WHERE {?s ?p ?o }
 * </code> Does not need a projection as the inner statement pattern returns the same result.
 *
 * While <code>
 *  * SELECT ?s ?p
 * WHERE {?s ?p ?o }
 * </code> Does as the statement pattern has one more variable in use than the projection.
 *
 * Note: this optimiser should run after optimisations ran that depend on Projections. e.g.
