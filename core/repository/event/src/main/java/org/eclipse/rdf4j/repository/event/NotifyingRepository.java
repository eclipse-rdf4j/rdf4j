	 * Opens a connection to this repository that can be used for querying and updating the contents of the repository.
	 * Created connections need to be closed to make sure that any resources they keep hold of are released. The best
	 * way to do this is to use a try-finally-block as follows:
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * Connection con = repository.getConnection();
	 * try {
	 * 	// perform operations on the connection
	 * } finally {
	 * 	con.close();
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * Note that {@link RepositoryConnection} is not guaranteed to be thread-safe! The recommended pattern for
	 * repository access in a multithreaded application is to share the Repository object between threads, but have each
	 * thread create and use its own {@link RepositoryConnection}s.
	 *
	 * @return A connection that allows operations on this repository.
	 * @throws RepositoryException If something went wrong during the creation of the Connection.
