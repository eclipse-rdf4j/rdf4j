/**
 * The Repository API: the main API for accessing rdf databases and SPARQL endpoints.
 *
 * The class {@link org.eclipse.rdf4j.repository.Repository} is the main interface for rdf4j repositories. It provides
 * all sorts of operations for manipulating RDF in various ways, through a
 * {@link org.eclipse.rdf4j.repository.RepositoryConnection}.
 *
 * An important notion in a rdf4j repository is that of <strong>context</strong> . Within one repository, subsets of
 * statements can be identified by their context.
