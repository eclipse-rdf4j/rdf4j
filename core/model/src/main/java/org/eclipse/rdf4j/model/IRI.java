/**
 * An Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI). IRIs are an extension of the existing {@link URI}: while URIs are
 * limited to a subset of the ASCII character set, IRIs may contain characters from the Universal Character Set
 * (Unicode/ISO 10646), including Chinese or Japanese kanji, Korean, Cyrillic characters, and so forth. It is defined by
 * RFC 3987.
 * <p>
 * An IRI can be split into a namespace part and a local name part, which are derived from an IRI string by splitting it
 * in two using the following algorithm:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Split after the first occurrence of the '#' character,
 * <li>If this fails, split after the last occurrence of the '/' character,
 * <li>If this fails, split after the last occurrence of the ':' character.
 * </ul>
 * The last step should never fail as every legal (full) IRI contains at least one ':' character to seperate the scheme
 * from the rest of the IRI. The implementation should check this upon object creation.
 *
 * @see <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987">RFC 3987</a>
