	 * In RDF-1.1, all RDF-1.0 Language Literals are typed using rdf:langString in the abstract model, but
	 * this datatype is not necessary for concrete syntaxes.
	 * <p>
	 * In most concrete syntaxes it is either syntactically invalid or semantically ambiguous to have a
	 * language tagged literal with an explicit datatype. In those cases this setting will not be used, and
	 * the rdf:langString datatype will not be attached to language tagged literals.
	 * <p>
	 * In particular, in RDF/XML, if rdf:langString is serialised, the language tag may not be retained when
	 * the document is parsed due to the precedence rule in RDF/XML for datatype over language.
	 * <p>
	 * Defaults to true as rdf:langString was not previously used, and should not be commonly required.
