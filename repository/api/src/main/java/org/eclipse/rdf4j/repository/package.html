        <p> The Repository API: the main API for handling RDF4J repositories. </p>
        <p> The class {@link org.eclipse.rdf4j.repository.Repository} is the main interface for RDF4J repositories. It provides all sorts of operations for manipulating RDF in various ways, through a {@link org.eclipse.rdf4j.repository.RepositoryConnection}. </p>
        <p>
             An important notion in a RDF4J repository is that of 
            <strong>context</strong>
            . Within one repository, subsets of statements can be identified by their context.
