        <p>A repository that serves as a proxy client for a remote repository on a Sesame Server.</p> 
        <p>
             Note that this proxy implements a 
            <b>Sesame-specific extension</b>
             of the basic SPARQL protocol, and therefore should not be used to communicate with non-Sesame SPARQL endpoints. For such endpoints, use SPARQLRepository instead.
