	<p>A repository that serves as a proxy client for a remote
		repository on a Sesame Server.</p>
	<p>
		Note that this proxy implements a <b>Sesame-specific
			extension</b> of the basic SPARQL protocol, and therefore should not be
		used to communicate with non-Sesame SPARQL endpoints. For such
		endpoints, use SPARQLRepository instead.
