	<p>A repository that serves as a client for a SPARQL endpoint.</p>
	<p>
		A SPARQL endpoint is any web service that implements the <a
			href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/">SPARQL 1.1
			Protocol</a> - a means of conveying SPARQL queries and updates to SPARQL
		processors.
	</p>
	<p>Since every Sesame repository running on a Sesame Server is also
		a SPARQL endpoint, it is possible to use the SPARQLRepository to
		access such a repository. However, it is recommended to instead use
		HTTPRepository, which has a number of Sesame-specific optimizations
		that make client-server communication more scalable, and
		transaction-safe.</p>
