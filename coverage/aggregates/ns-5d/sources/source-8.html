&nbsp;	 * compiler has compiled the code (C1 vs C2) and based on what is or isn&#39;t cached in memory. If Timed explanations
&nbsp;	 * are considerably slower than Executed explanations the overhead with timing the query may be large on your system
&nbsp;	 * and should not be trusted.

&nbsp;	 * WARNING: This method is experimental and is subject to change or removal without warning. Same goes for the

&nbsp;	 *              executed/evaluated, including some real performance metrics), Timed (as was executed/evaluated
&nbsp;	 *              including all real performance metrics). Executed and Timed level can potentially be slow.
