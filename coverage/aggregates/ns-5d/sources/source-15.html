&nbsp; * This interface contains methods for optionally processing both boolean and tuple results sets simultaneously, but
&nbsp; * there are no guarantees that an implementation will be able to process these values together. If a method is not
&nbsp; * supported then an {@link UnsupportedOperationException} will be thrown to indicate this failure. This failure may be
&nbsp; * prevented by checking for whether the class implements {@link BooleanQueryResultHandler} or
&nbsp; * {@link TupleQueryResultHandler}, for boolean and tuple results support respectively.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * If both boolean and tuple results are supported but they are not able to to be processed simultaneously, then a
&nbsp; * checked exception, either {@link BooleanQueryResultHandlerException} or {@link TupleQueryResultHandlerException},
&nbsp; * will be thrown to indicate this failure when the relevant methods are called.
