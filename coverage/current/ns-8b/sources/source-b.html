&nbsp; * An RDF4J repository that contains RDF data that can be queried and updated. Access to the repository can be acquired
&nbsp; * by opening a connection to it. This connection can then be used to query and/or update the contents of the
&nbsp; * repository. Depending on the implementation of the repository, it may or may not support multiple concurrent
&nbsp; * connections.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Please note that a repository should be shut down before it is discarded/garbage collected. Forgetting the latter can
&nbsp; * result in loss of data (depending on the Repository implementation)!
