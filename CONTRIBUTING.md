# Contributing to Eclipse RDF4J

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

Eclipse RDF4Jâ„¢ is an RDF (Resource Description Framework) Java framework. It
provides functionality for efficient and scalable parsing, storage, querying,
and reasoning with RDF data, and a vendor-neutral access API for RDF databases
(a.k.a.  "triplestores"). Some feature highlights: full support for SPARQL 1.1
query and update; fast and efficient parsing of all common RDF formats through
the Rio parser toolkit; an easy to use, lightweight, modern Java API for
handling RDF in code; support for RDF Schema reasoning as well as
SHACL validation; fast in-memory RDF database with optional file-backed
persistence; fast Native RDF database with full binary persistence to disk;
convenient access to third-party RDF database implementations and remote SPARQL
endpoints In addition to its primary use as a set of Java libraries, RDF4J also
provides the RDF4J Server web application. RDF4J Server allows you quickly spin
up an RDF database and publish it as a SPARQL Endpoint. The separately
distributed RDF4J Workbench provides a (web-based) client user interface for an
RDF4J Server, with a full SPARQL query editor (with completion features and
syntax highlighting), and several convenient ways to manipulate or explore the
data in any RDF database/SPARQL endpoint.
