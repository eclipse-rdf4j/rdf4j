         RDF Model API 
        <p>The RDF model interfaces are organized in the following hierarchy:</p> 
        <pre>       Value          Statement       Model
      /     \
     /       \
 Resource  Literal
   /  \
  /    \
IRI   BNode
</pre> 
        <p>
             An individual RDF triple or statement is represented by the 
            <code>Statement</code>
             interface. Collections of RDF statements are represented by the 
            <code>Model</code>
             interface. 
        </p> 
        <p>
             Creation of new Model elements (IRIs, Literals, BNodes, Statements) is done by means of a 
            <code>ValueFactory</code> 
        </p>
