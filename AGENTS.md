# Codex Agent Playbook

Welcome, AI Agent! Your persistence, curiosity, and craftsmanship make a difference. Take your time, work methodically, validate thoroughly, and iterate. This repository is large and tests can take time — that’s expected and supported.

> **Timebox:** Aim to complete each autonomous run in **15–30 minutes**.

## Purpose & Contract
- **Bold goal:** deliver correct, minimal, well‑tested changes with clear handoff. No monkey‑patching or band‑aid fixes — always fix the underlying problem at its source.
- **Bias to action:** when inputs are ambiguous, choose a reasonable path, state assumptions, and proceed.
- **Ask only when blocked or irreversible:** escalate only if truly blocked (permissions, missing deps, conflicting requirements) or if a choice is high‑risk/irreversible.
- **Definition of Done**
  - Code formatted and imports sorted.
  - Compiles with a quick profile / targeted modules.
  - Relevant module tests pass; failures triaged or crisply explained.
  - Only necessary files changed; headers correct for new files.
  - Clear final summary: what changed, why, where, how verified, next steps.

### No Monkey‑Patching or Band‑Aid Fixes (Non‑Negotiable)

This repository requires durable, root‑cause fixes. Superficial changes that mask symptoms, mute tests, or add ad‑hoc toggles are not acceptable.

What this means in practice
- Find and fix the root cause in the correct layer/module.
- Add or adjust targeted tests that fail before the fix and pass after.
- Keep changes minimal and surgical; do not widen APIs/configs to “make tests green”.
- Maintain consistency with existing style and architecture; prefer refactoring over hacks.

Strictly avoid
- Sleeping/timeouts to hide race conditions or flakiness.
- Broad catch‑and‑ignore or logging‑and‑continue of exceptions.
- Muting, deleting, or weakening assertions in tests to pass builds.
- Reflection or internal state manipulation to bypass proper interfaces.
- Feature flags/toggles that disable validation or logic instead of fixing it.
- Changing public APIs or configs without necessity and clear rationale tied to the root cause.

Preferred approach (fast and rigorous)
- Reproduce the issue and isolate the smallest failing test (class → method).
- Trace to the true source; fix it in the right module.
- Add focused tests covering the behavior and any critical edge cases.
- Run tight, targeted verifies for the impacted module(s) and broaden scope only if needed.

Review bar and enforcement
- Treat this policy as a blocking requirement. Changes that resemble workarounds will be rejected.
- Your final handoff must demonstrate: failing test before the fix, explanation of the root cause, minimal fix at source, and passing targeted tests after.

## Environment
- **JDK:** 11 (minimum). The project builds and runs on Java 11+.
- **Maven default:** run **offline** using `-o` whenever possible.
- **Network:** only when needed to fetch missing deps/plugins; then rerun the exact command **without** `-o` once, and return to offline.
- **Large project:** some module test suites can take **5–10 minutes**. Be patient, but bias toward **targeted** runs to keep momentum.

### Maven `-am` usage (house rule)

`-am` (also-make) pulls in required upstream modules. That’s helpful for **compiles**, but hazardous for **tests**: Maven will advance included modules to the same lifecycle phase and run **their** tests too.

**Rule of thumb**
- ✅ Use `-am` **only** for compile/verify with tests skipped (e.g. `-Pquick`).:
  - `mvn -o -pl <module> -am -Pquick verify`
- ❌ Do **not** use `-am` with `verify` when tests are enabled.

**Two-step pattern (fast + safe)**
1) **Compile deps fast (skip tests):**  
   `mvn -o -pl <module> -am -Pquick verify`
2) **Run tests:**  
   `mvn -o -pl <module> verify | tail -500`

It is illegal to `-am` when running tests!
It is illegal to `-q` when running tests!

## Quick Start (First 10 Minutes)
1. **Discover**
  - List modules: inspect root `pom.xml` (aggregator) and the module tree (see “Maven Module Overview” below).
  - Search fast with ripgrep: `rg -n "<symbol or string>"`
2. **Build sanity (fast, skip tests)**
  - **Preferred:** `mvn -o -Pquick install | tail -200`
  - **Alternative:** `mvn -o -Pquick verify | tail -200`
3. **Format (Java, imports, XML)**
  - `mvn -o -q -T 2C formatter:format impsort:sort xml-format:xml-format`
4. **Targeted tests (tight loops)**
  - By module (incl. deps): `mvn -o -pl <module> verify  | tail -500`
  - Single class: `mvn -o -pl <module> -Dtest=ClassName verify  | tail -500`
  - Single method: `mvn -o -pl <module> -Dtest=ClassName#method verify | tail -500`
5. **Inspect failures**
  - **Unit (Surefire):** `<module>/target/surefire-reports/`
  - **IT (Failsafe):** `<module>/target/failsafe-reports/`

It is illegal to `-am` when running tests!
It is illegal to `-q` when running tests!


## Working Loop
- **Plan**
  - Break task into **small, verifiable steps**; keep one step in progress.
  - Announce a short preamble before long actions (builds/tests).
  - Decide and proceed autonomously; document assumptions inline.
- **Change**
  - Make minimal, surgical edits. Keep style and structure consistent.
- **Format**
  - `mvn -o -q -T 2C formatter:format impsort:sort xml-format:xml-format`
- **Compile (fast)**
  - **Iterate locally:** `mvn -o -pl <module> -am -Pquick verify | tail -500`
- **Test**
  - Start with the smallest scope that exercises your change (class → module).
  - For integration‑impacted changes, run module `verify` (includes ITs).
- **Triage**
  - Read reports; fix root cause; expand scope **only when needed**.
- **Iterate**
  - Keep moving without waiting for permission between steps. Escalate only at blocking points.
  - Repeat until **Definition of Done** is satisfied.

It is illegal to `-am` when running tests!
It is illegal to `-q` when running tests!

## Planning & Progress
- **Living plan:** update as you learn; one active step at a time (5–7 words each).
- **Progress updates:** one crisp sentence when switching steps or after long runs.
- **Decide early:** if scope is unclear, pick the most reasonable option, note the assumption, and continue.
- **Escalate sparingly:** ask only if options diverge significantly in cost/impact or you are blocked (permissions, network policy, missing secrets).
- **Checkpoint cadence:** inform to maintain visibility; do **not** block on approvals unless required.

## Testing Strategy
- **Prefer module tests you touched:** `-pl <module>`
- **Narrow further** to a class/method for tight loops; then broaden to the module.
- **Expand scope** when:
  - Your change crosses module boundaries, or
  - Neighbor module failures indicate integration impact.
- **Read reports**
  - Surefire (unit): `target/surefire-reports/`
  - Failsafe (IT): `target/failsafe-reports/`
- **Helpful flags**
  - `-Dtest=Class#method` (unit selection)
  - `-Dit.test=ITClass#method` (integration selection)
  - `-DtrimStackTrace=false` (full traces)
  - `-DskipITs` (focus on unit tests)
  - `-DfailIfNoTests=false` (when selecting a class that has no tests on some platforms)

## Assertions: Make invariants explicit

Assertions are executable claims about what must be true. They’re the fastest way to surface “impossible” states and to localize bugs at the line that crossed a boundary it had no business crossing. Use them both as **temporary tripwires** during investigation and as **permanent contracts** once an invariant is known to matter.

**Two useful flavors**

- **Temporary tripwires (debug asserts):** Add while hunting a failing test or weird behavior. Keep them cheap, contextual, and local to the suspect path. Remove after the mystery is solved **or** convert to permanent checks if the invariant is genuinely important.
- **Permanent contracts:** Encode **preconditions** (valid inputs), **postconditions** (valid outputs), and **invariants** (state that must always hold). These stay and prevent regressions.

**Where to add assertions**

- At **module boundaries** and **after parsing/external calls** (validate assumptions about returned/decoded data).
- Around **state transitions** (illegal transitions should fail loudly).
- In **concurrency hotspots** (e.g., “lock must be held”, “no concurrent mutation”).
- Before/after **caching, batching, or memoization** (keys, sizes, ordering, monotonicity).
- For **exhaustive enums** in `switch` statements (treat unexpected values as hard errors).

**How to write good assertions**

- One fact per assert. Fail **fast**, fail **usefully**.
- Include **stable context** in the message (ids, sizes, states) so the failure is self‑explanatory.
- Avoid side effects in the condition or message. Assertions may be disabled in some runtimes.
- Keep them **cheap**: no I/O, heavy allocations, or deep logging in the message.
- Don’t use asserts for **user‑facing validation**. Raise exceptions for expected bad inputs.

**Java specifics**

- **Enable VM assertions in tests.** Tests must run with `-ea` so `assert` is active.
- Use **`assert`** for debug‑only invariants that “cannot happen.” Use **exceptions** for runtime guarantees:
    - Preconditions: `IllegalArgumentException` / `Objects.requireNonNull` (or Guava `Preconditions` if present).
    - Invariants: `IllegalStateException`.
- Prefer treating unexpected enum values as **hard errors** rather than adding a quiet `default` path.

**Concrete examples**

Precondition (permanent)
```java
void setPort(int port) {
  if (port < 1 || port > 65_535) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("port out of range: " + port);
  }
  this.port = port;
}
```

Invariant (permanent)
```java
void advance(State next) {
  if (!allowedTransitions.get(state).contains(next)) {
    throw new IllegalStateException("Illegal transition " + state + " → " + next);
  }
  state = next;
}
```

Debug tripwire (temporary; remove or convert later)
```java
// Narrow a flaky failure around ordering
assert isSorted(results) : "unsorted results, size=" + results.size() + " ids=" + ids(results);
```

Unreachable (hard error)
```java
switch (kind) {
  case A: return handleA();
  case B: return handleB();
  default:
    throw new IllegalStateException("Unhandled kind: " + kind);
}
```

Concurrency assumption
```java
synchronized void put(String k, String v) {
  assert Thread.holdsLock(this) : "put must hold instance monitor";
  // ...
}
```


House rule: Asserts are allowed and encouraged. Removing or weakening an assertion to “make it pass” is strictly forbidden — fix the cause, not the guardrail.


## Triage Playbook
- **Missing dep/plugin offline**
  - Remedy: **rerun the exact command without `-o`** once to fetch; then return offline.
- **Compilation errors**
  - Fix imports, generics, visibility; re‑run quick verify (skip tests) in the **module**.
- **Flaky/slow tests**
  - Run the specific failing test; read its report; stabilize root cause before broad runs.
- **Formatting failures**
  - Run formatter/import/XML sort; re‑verify.
- **License header missing**
  - Add header for **new** files only (see “Source File Headers”); **do not** change years on existing files.

## Code Formatting
- **Always run before finalizing:**
  - `mvn -o -q -T 2C formatter:format impsort:sort xml-format:xml-format`
- **Style:** no wildcard imports; 120‑char width; curly braces always; LF line endings.
- **Tip:** formatting/import sort may be validated during `verify`. Running the commands proactively avoids CI/style failures.

## Source File Headers
Use this exact header for **new Java files only** (replace `${year}` with current year):

```
/*******************************************************************************
 * Copyright (c) ${year} Eclipse RDF4J contributors.
 *
 * All rights reserved. This program and the accompanying materials
 * are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Distribution License v1.0
 * which accompanies this distribution, and is available at
 * http://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/edl-v10.php.
 *
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause
 *******************************************************************************/
 ```

Use this exact header. Be very precise.

Do **not** modify existing headers’ years.

## Pre‑Commit Checklist
- **Format:** `mvn -o -q -T 2C formatter:format impsort:sort xml-format:xml-format`
- **Compile (fast path):** `mvn -o -Pquick verify | tail -200`
- **Tests (targeted):** `mvn -o -pl <module> verify | tail -500` (broaden scope if needed)
- **Reports:** zero new failures in `target/surefire-reports/` or `target/failsafe-reports/`, or explain precisely.

## Navigation & Search
- Fast file search: `rg --files`
- Fast content search: `rg -n "<pattern>"`
- Read big files in chunks:
  - `sed -n '1,200p' path/to/File.java`
  - `sed -n '201,400p' path/to/File.java`

## Autonomy Rules (Act > Ask)
- **Default:** act with assumptions. Document assumptions in your plan and final answer.
- **Keep going:** chain steps without waiting for permission; send short progress updates before long actions.
- **Ask only when:**
  - Blocked by sandbox/approvals/network policy or missing secrets.
  - The decision is destructive/irreversible, repo‑wide, or impacts public APIs.
  - Adding dependencies, changing build profiles, or altering licensing.
- **Prefer reversible moves:** take the smallest local change that unblocks progress; validate with targeted tests before expanding scope.
- **Choose defaults**
  - **Tests:** start with `-pl <module>`, then `-Dtest=Class#method` / `-Dit.test=ITClass#method`.
  - **Build:** use `-o` quick/profiled commands; briefly drop `-o` to fetch missing deps, then return offline.
  - **Formatting:** run formatter/impsort/xml‑format proactively before verify.
  - **Reports:** read surefire/failsafe locally; expand scope only when necessary.
- **Error handling**
  - On compile/test failure: fix root cause locally, rerun targeted tests, then broaden.
  - On flaky tests: rerun class/method; stabilize cause before repo‑wide runs.
  - On formatting/license issues: apply prescribed commands/headers immediately.
- **Communication**
  - **Preambles:** 1–2 sentences grouping upcoming actions.
  - **Updates:** inform to maintain visibility; do **not** request permission unless in “Ask only when” above.

## Answer Template (Use This)
- **What changed:** summary of approach and rationale.
- **Files touched:** list file paths.
- **Commands run:** key build/test commands.
- **Verification:** which tests passed, where you checked reports.
- **Assumptions:** key assumptions and autonomous decisions you made.
- **Limitations:** anything left or risky edge cases.
- **Next steps:** optional suggestions for follow‑ups.

## Running Tests
- By module:
  - `mvn -o -pl core/sail/shacl verify | tail -500`
- Entire repo:
  - `mvn -o verify` (long; only when appropriate)
- Useful flags:
  - `-Dtest=ClassName`
  - `-Dtest=ClassName#method`
  - `-Dit.test=ITClass#method`
  - `-DtrimStackTrace=false`

## Build
- **Build without tests (fast path):**
  - `mvn -o -Pquick verify`
- **Verify with tests:**
  - Targeted module(s): `mvn -o -pl <module> verify`
  - Entire repo: `mvn -o verify` (use only when appropriate)
- **When offline fails due to missing deps:**
  - Re‑run the **exact** command **without** `-o` once to fetch, then return to `-o`.

## Safety & Boundaries
- Don’t commit or push unless explicitly asked.
- Don’t add new dependencies without explicit approval.
- Use approvals sparingly: request approval only for network fetches when offline fails, destructive operations, or repo‑wide impacts. Otherwise proceed locally and continue working.


It is illegal to `-am` when running tests!
It is illegal to `-q` when running tests!
You must follow these rules and instructions exactly as stated.
